Music-synchronised lighting software.

## About
`essaim` provides a way to to control DMX-compatible hardware and displays (screens, video projectors) with MIDI controllers for music shows. Essaim connects to the music source (DAW, DJ Controller, etc) to ensure lightning and effects are beat-syncronised to the music source.
Additionally, essaim handles processing video or depth sensing camera streams which can then be projected during the show.

Essaim's development is currently in progress.
